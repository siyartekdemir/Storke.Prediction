# Stroke Predicition

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Creating a machine learning model for stroke prediction according to given datasets. This project contains cleaning the data, preprocessing the data, visualize the data, splitting the data and try to find out the most suitable model for this stroke prediction sections and also feauture engineering process. I combined two different dataset as a train dataset.

## Evaluation

I evalueate the model with different types of methods and parameters.

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

| Model name         | SVC | RFC |   LinReg    |   LogReg    |
| ------------------ |-----|-----|-------------|-------------|
| My awesome model   | 95% | 96% | 0.037 (MSE) | 0.046 (MSE) |
